Numbers FAQ 
=============
1. What's the difference between floating point and an integer?

An integer has no decimals in it, a floating point number can display digits past the decimal point.

2. Why doesn't 0.1+0.2-0.3 equal 0.0 ?

This has to do with floating point accuracy and computer's abilities to represent numbers in memory. For a full breakdown, check out: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html


Strings FAQ
=============
1. Are strings mutable?

Strings are not mutable! (meaning you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string)

2. How do I create comments in my code?

You can use the hashtag # to create comments in your code

Lists FAQ
=============
1. How do I index a nested list? For example if I want to grab 2 from [1,1,[1,2]]?

You would just add another set of brackets for indexing the nested list, for example: my_list[2][1] . We'll discover later on more nested objects and you will be quizzed on them later!

Dictionaries FAQ

1. Do dictionaries keep an order? How do I print the values of the dictionary in order?

Dictionaries are mappings and do not retain order! If you do want the capabilities of a dictionary but you would like ordering as well, check out the ordereddict object lecture later on in the course!
